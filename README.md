# machinelearning-concepts

Machine learning is to make a system to take decision based on previous experience

Like humans 

1. We learn from past experiences(Dataset)
2. Create a rule from experiences(ML Model)
3. Apply the rule when face with new expereince(Prediction)

## Key terminologies

Dataset 
- It is information or collection of facts.
- Each row is a datapoint and the columns as features
- Feaures are properties or characteristics of data
- Labels or target is the feature which we are trying to predict


2 types of data 
Labelled Data
Unlabeled dataset

Type of Machine Learinig

3 types 

1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement


Flow of Machine learning 

Dataset --> Get a sample data and split into training data and testing data.

Once we train on training data using machine learinig we will get a trained ML model

Using testing data and with Trainined ML model we will do perfiction and evalution 


Common machine learing algorithm - supervised

1. Linear Regression
2. Logisitc Regreession
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes Algorithm
6. SVM
7. KNN


Classes of Supervised Algorithm 

1. Regression - Target is a real value, continous number
2. Classification - Target is categorical
